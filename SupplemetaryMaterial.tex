\section{Membrane restrain protocol}

Membrane undulation is a known behavior in large lipid bilayer systems; when undulations are undesirable (as in our case) membrane restraint protocols have been used to prevent them\cite{Ingolfsson2014,Lin2019,Su2020}.
There are two common protocols that have been used previously: (a) position restraining a certain bead of specific lipid or
(b) applying a flat bottom restraint on the membrane.
For detailed explanation of how this is implemented, refer to the GROMACS manual\cite{GromacsManual}.

We chose flat-bottom restraints, where the lipids can move in the xy slab of predefined z thickness without any perturbation, because it is a smaller perturbation.
Thus, starting from the last 100 ns of NPT equilibration of lipid bilayer to the whole production run,
we introduced a flat-bottom restraint to the bilayer.\\

There are two parameters to choose: (a) How thick should be the planar slab where bilayer is free to move, and
(b) What should be the force constant to be used for the flat bottom potential
In order to decide on the former, we found the mass density distribution of NC3, PO4 and GL1 beads along z direction during the CHARMM-GUI relaxation protocol.
Based on the distributions at equilibration step, for the DPPC-DIPC-CHOL, we chose 2.3125 nm as the flat bottom well thickness, with respect to PO4 bead of DPPC and DIPC.
For the DPPC-DAPC-CHOL, we chose 2.5625 nm as the flat bottom well radius, with respect to PO4 bead of DPPC and DAPC.
We chose PO4 bead since the head group choline (NC3) seemed more flexible (as instead of a sharp peaks at each leaflets it has a more broader peaks at each sides of the plots), therefore for the NC3 bead average value has more uncertainity to it.
Also, PO4 bead to bead distance for DPPC and D(A/I)PC was different but we went with the idea of one height for both, at the outer edge of the farther one.
Also we only applied the flatbottom restraints for the longer DPPC and D(A/I)PC lipids and not for cholesterol.
We also tested flat bottom restrain radius = 21 A, 22 A, 23 A, 24 A, 25 A, 26 A, 27 A for DIPC system and checked whether the criteria we chose prevented bilayer undulation while not otherwise stiffening the bilayer.
Based on visual inspection,  it seems our choice of criteria was effective.

We tried flat bottom restraints with force constant, $k = 0.2, 2, 10, 20, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000$ KJ mol-1nm-2 for DIPC system.
We ran 100 ns NPT runs and observed that force constants below 1000 mol-1 nm-2 still allowed undulations. Based on this, as well a review of recent literature
\cite{Su2020}, we chose $k = 1000$ KJ mol-1 nm-2 for DIPC system.

\section{Auxiliary variables}

To assess the quality of DBSCAN clustering, for each lipid species $X_i$ in the system, we calculated the following, 

1. Number of $X_i$ clusters in the system under study.

2. Fraction of $X_i$ lipids in $X$ clusters

3. Fraction of $X_i$ lipids in $X$ core lipids.

4. Mean Silhouette Coefficient (MSC) of $X_i$ Clusters, as implemented in scikit-learn.

The Silhouette Coefficient, a method used to evaluate the clustering done by any technique, is defined as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SC}
\text{s} = \frac{b - a}{max(a,b)}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Here, for a $X_i$ lipid in the cluster, $a$ is the mean inter-lipid distance for $X_i$ lipids within a given cluster, and $b$ is the mean minimum distance between clusters. The former assesses the 'cohesion' of a given $X_i$ lipids with other $X_1$ lipids in a cluster, while the latter assesses the 'separation' from the nearest cluster.

The Mean Silhouette Coefficient of $X_i$ Clusters is given by the mean $s$ over all non-outlier $X_i$ lipids.
Here, we have omitted the MSC calculations for cases when there are no clusters or just one cluster detected by DBSCAN. 
MSC is bound between and -1 and 1.
A high positive value corresponds to well-segregated dense clusters, while a low negative value implies that lipids are assigned to clusters incorrectly.  

All these AVs were tracked along with the primary collective varibale, FLC, driving the WE simulation.
Following are the system specific profiles of each AVs:
