abstract = {The mixing of solids is a fundamentally important unit operation in the pharmaceutical, food and agricultural industries, as well as many others. The efficiency and quality of mixing can have a significant bearing on downstream processability and product quality. In spite of the fact that the equipment, usually batch blenders without impellers such as tumbling bins and V-Blenders or with impellers such as ploughshare mixers, is well established, there remains considerable uncertainty in the optimisation of mixing. Simple laboratory/pilot scale mixers based on the rotating drum, such as the hoop mixer and the Turbula, are commonly used and yet also little understood in terms of performance. These mixers add additional rotational and/or translational movements to the cylindrical rotation of the drum to deliver significant improvements in mixing, particularly in the longitudinal axis.Discrete Element Modelling (DEM), in which a flowing or deforming granular system is modelled by considering the movement of each individual particle and its interaction (momentum and energy exchange) with neighbours and boundaries, has recently become accessible to relatively non-expert users. The reasons for this include: increasing confidence in its capability; user-friendly graphical interfaces of commercial software packages; and the fact that top end personal computers now have sufficient memory and computational speed to enable many problems to be solved in weeks rather than months.The purpose of the work reported here is to evaluate the power of DEM to help understand flow processes and explain mixing mechanisms in mixing equipment based on the rotating drum. The commercial package EDEM (from DEM Solutions) was used. For speed and simplicity the modelled system comprised monosized smooth glass beads. Three mixers were selected: horizontal rotating drum, the hoop mixer and the Turbula. The rate and extent of mixing, quantified using a "segregation index" based on contacts between two discretely labelled but otherwise identical fractions, was shown to depend on equipment motion, operating speed and the initial distribution of the fractions. The well known characteristics of the horizontal drum operating in rolling mode were demonstrated: excellent transverse mixing and poor axial mixing; both improving with speed as the depth of the active layer is shown to increase. The hoop mixer incorporates off-axis rotation, causing periodic tilting of the cylinder axis. This results in a considerable improvement in axial mixing. Interestingly, at low speeds the hoop mixer and simple rotating drum exhibit similar transverse mixing but increasing speed has the opposite effect: improving transverse mixing in the drum while worsening it in the hoop. Axial mixing in the hoop mixer, on the other hand improves with speed. The Turbula displays a very interesting relationship with speed. At low speeds, its transverse mixing performance is the same as the horizontal drum and hoop mixer but decreases significantly with increasing speed, going through a minimum at medium speed before recovering completely at high speed. Axial mixing is comparable, showing the same trend. It appears that the motion in the Turbula goes through some sort of transition that has a profound effect on mixing performance. The implication is that unless this is understood, it will be difficult a priori to identify optimum operating conditions.The power of DEM lies in the fact that the complete trajectory of each particle is recorded: it is possible to follow the movement, deformation and breakup of clusters of particles. From this it should be possible to elucidate the dominant flow mechanisms and to identify those that have the most impact on mixing. This presents a challenge to develop methodologies for cluster analysis and visualisation and is the subject of on-going work. Other work is focussed on experimental validation of the DEM predictions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Martini coarse-grained force field has been successfully used for simulating a wide range of (bio)molecular systems. Recent progress in our ability to test the model against fully atomistic force fields, however, has revealed some shortcomings. Most notable, phenylalanine and proline were too hydrophobic, and dimers formed by polar residues in apolar solvents did not bind strongly enough. Here, we reparametrize these residues either through reassignment of particle types or by introducing embedded charges. The new parameters are tested with respect to partitioning across a lipid bilayer, membrane binding of Wimley-White peptides, and dimerization free energy in solvents of different polarity. In addition, we improve some of the bonded terms in the Martini protein force field that lead to a more realistic length of $\alpha$-helices and to improved numerical stability for polyalanine and glycine repeats. The new parameter set is denoted Martini version 2.2. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We studied compositionally heterogeneous multi-component model membranes comprised of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, cholesterol, and $\alpha$-helical TM protein models using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Reducing the mismatch between the length of the saturated and unsaturated lipid tails reduced the driving force for segregation into liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) lipid domains. Cholesterol depletion had a similar effect, and binary lipid mixtures without cholesterol did not undergo large-scale phase separation under the simulation conditions. The phase-separating ternary dipalmitoyl- phosphatidylcholine (DPPC)/dilinoleoyl-PC (DLiPC)/cholesterol bilayer was found to segregate into lo and ld domains also in the presence of a high concentration of ΤΜ helices. The ld domain was highly crowded with TM helices (protein-to-lipid ratio {\~{}} 1:5), slowing down lateral diffusion by a factor of 5-10 as compared to the dilute case, with anomalous (sub)-diffusion on the $\mu$s time scale. The membrane with the less strongly unsaturated palmitoyl-linoleoyl-PC instead of DLiPC, which in the absence of TM $\alpha$-helices less strongly deviated from ideal mixing, could be brought closer to a miscibility critical point by introducing a high concentration of TM helices. Finally, the 7-TM protein bacteriorhodopsin was found to partition into the ld domains irrespective of hydrophobic matching. These results show that it is possible to directly study the lateral reorganization of lipids and proteins in compositionally heterogeneous and crowded model biomembranes with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, a step toward simulations of realistic, compositionally complex cellular membranes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The transmembrane domain (TMD) of membrane proteins plays an essential role in their dynamics and functions. Certain properties of TMDs, such as raft affinity and orientation, have been studied extensively both experimentally and computationally. However, the extent to which specific physicochemical properties of TMDs determine their membrane domain-partitioning thermodynamics is still far from clear. In this work, we propose an approach based on umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations of model membranes and idealized TMDs to quantify the effect of TMD physicochemical properties, namely, length, degree of hydrophobicity, and size of TMDs, on their membrane domain-partitioning thermodynamics. The results, which are fully consistent with previous experimental and simulation data, indicate that the concept of "hydrophobic mismatch" should go beyond differences in hydrophobic thickness to include mismatch in the degree of hydrophobicity between the TMD and the surrounding hydrocarbon lipid chains. Our method provides quantitative insights into the role of specific physicochemical features of TMDs in membrane localization and orientation, which will be broadly useful for predicting the raft affinity and membrane partitioning of any transmembrane protein.},

abstract = {Cholesterol is the most abundant molecule in the plasma membrane of mammals. Its distribution across the two membrane leaflets is critical for understanding how cells work. Cholesterol trans-bilayer motion (flip-flop) is a key process influencing its distribution in membranes. Despite extensive investigations, the rate of cholesterol flip-flop and its dependence on the lateral heterogeneity of membranes remain uncertain. In this work, we used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to sample spontaneous cholesterol flip-flop events in a DPPC:DOPC:cholesterol mixture with heterogeneous lateral distribution of lipids. In addition to an overall flip-flop rate at the time scale of sub-milliseconds, we identified a significant impact of local environment on flip-flop rate. We discuss the atomistic details of the flip-flop events observed in our simulations.},

abstract = {The phase behavior of the coarse-grained MARTINI model for three-component lipid bilayers composed of dipalmytoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol (Chol), and an unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) was systematically investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The aim of this study is to understand which types of unsaturated PC induce the formation of thermodynamically stable coexisting phases when added to mixtures of DPPC and Chol and to unravel the mechanisms that drive phase separation in such three-component mixtures. Our simulations indicate that the currently used MARTINI force field does not induce such phase separation in mixtures of DPPC, Chol, and unsaturated PCs with a low unsaturation level, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) or dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Also, we found that phase separation does occur in mixtures of DPPC, Chol, and polyunsaturated PCs, such as dilinoleyl-phosphatidylcholine (DUPC) and diarachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DAPC). Through systematic tweaking of the interactions between the hydrophobic groups of the PC molecules, we show that the appearance of phase separation in three-component lipid bilayers, as modeled through the MARTINI force field, is primarily due to the interactions between the coarse-grained molecules, i.e., the beads, rather than due to the differences between the conformations of saturated and unsaturated lipid acyl chains, namely entropy driven.

abstract = {We present an improved and extended version of our coarse grained lipid model. The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Here, we use computer simulations and optical microscopy to study the sorting of transmembrane helices into the liquid-disordered domains of phase-separated model membranes, irrespective of peptide-lipid hydrophobic mismatch. Free energy calculations show that the enthalpic contribution due to the packing of the lipids drives the lateral sorting of the helices. Hydrophobic mismatch regulates the clustering into either small dynamic or large static aggregates.

abstract = {Understanding the lateral organization in plasma membranes remains an open problem despite a large body of research. Model membranes with coexisting micrometer-size domains are routinely employed as simplified models of plasma membranes. Many molecular dynamics simulations have investigated phase separation in model membranes at the coarse-grained level, but atomistic simulations remain computationally challenging. We simulate DPPC:DOPC and DPPC:DOPC:cholesterol lipid bilayers to investigate phase transitions at temperatures from 310 to 270 K. In this temperature range, the binary mixture forms a liquid phase (L$\alpha$) and a coexistence of L$\alpha$ and either gel or ripple phases. The ternary mixture forms a liquid disordered (Ld) phase and a coexistence of liquid ordered (Lo) and either Ld or gel phases. We quantify the coexisting phases and discuss their properties against the background of experimental results. We observe partial registration of growing domains in both mixtures. We characterize specific cholesterol-cholesterol and cholesterol-phospholipid interaction geometries underlying its increased partitioning and the smoothed phase transition in the ternary mixture compared to the binary mixture. By comparing coexisting domains with homogeneous bilayers of the same composition, we demonstrate how domain coexistence affects their properties. Our simulations provide important insights into the lipid-lipid interactions in model lipid bilayers and improve our understanding of the lateral organization in plasma membranes with higher compositional complexity.},

abstract = {Biological membranes contain a broad variety of lipid species whose individual physicochemical properties and collective interactions ultimately determine membrane organization. A key aspect of the organization of cellular membranes is their lateral subdivision into domains of distinct structure and composition. The most widely studied membrane domains are lipid rafts, which are the biological manifestations of liquid-ordered phases that form in sterol-containing membranes. Detailed studies of biomimetic membrane mixtures have yielded wide-ranging insights into the physical principles behind lipid rafts; however, these simplified models do not fully capture the diversity and complexity of the mammalian lipidome, most notably in their exclusion of polyunsaturated lipids. Here, we assess the role of lipid acyl chain unsaturation as a driving force for phase separation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations validated by model membrane experiments. The clear trends in our observations and good qualitative agreements between simulations and experiments support the conclusions that highly unsaturated lipids promote liquid-liquid domain stability by enhancing the differences in cholesterol content and lipid chain order between the coexisting domains. These observations reveal the important role of noncanonical biological lipids in the physical properties of membranes, showing that lipid polyunsaturation is a driving force for liquid-liquid phase separation.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have become an essential tool to study a large variety of biomolecular processes, exploring temporal and spatial scales inaccessible to traditional models of atomistic resolution. One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment, is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate. First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane. The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the second application we consider the electroporation process of both an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Yesylevskyy et al.},

abstract = {Transient simulations of dynamic systems, using physics-based scientific computing tools, are practically limited by availability of computational resources and power. While the promise of machine learning has been explored in a variety of scientific disciplines, its application in creation of a framework for computationally expensive transient models has not been fully explored. Here, we present an ensemble approach where one such computationally expensive tool, discrete element method, is combined with time-series forecasting via auto regressive integrated moving average and machine learning methods to simulate a complex pharmaceutical problem: development of an agitation protocol in an agitated filter dryer to ensure uniform solid bed mixing. This ensemble approach leads to a significant reduction in the computational burden, while retaining model accuracy and performance, practically rendering simulations possible. The developed machine-learning model shows good predictability and agreement with the literature, demonstrating its tremendous potential in scientific computing.},

@article{Su2020,
abstract = {We performed coarse-grained simulations of the antimicrobial peptides Magainin-2, BP100, MSI-103, and MSI-78 on a phase-separated membrane to study their preference for the different domains. All the peptides displayed a clear preference for the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase over the liquid-ordered (Lo) one. For BP100, MSI-103, and MSI-78 there was a further preference of the peptides for the domain interface. The peptides' preference toward the disordered phase was shown to reflect a penalization of lipid–lipid interaction enthalpy in the Lo phase, when in the vicinity of peptides. Similar results were observed at the two studied concentrations, although Ld phase saturation at the higher concentration drove some of the peptide excess to the Lo phase. Magainin-2 and MSI-103 were found to dimerize, in agreement with available experimental data. Interestingly, at high concentrations of Magainin-2 toroidal pores spontaneously formed in the Ld phase. We performed additional simulations to characterize this phenomenon, which is likely related to Magainin-2's membranolytic action.},

@article{Torrillo2021,
abstract = {A promising approach for simulating rare events with rigorous kinetics is the weighted ensemble path sampling strategy. One challenge of this strategy is the division of configurational space into bins for sampling. Here we present a minimal adaptive binning (MAB) scheme for the automated, adaptive placement of bins along a progress coordinate within the framework of the weighted ensemble strategy. Results reveal that the MAB binning scheme, despite its simplicity, is more efficient than a manual, fixed binning scheme in generating transitions over large free energy barriers, generating a diversity of pathways, estimating rate constants, and sampling conformations. The scheme is general and extensible to any rare-events sampling strategy that employs progress coordinates.},

@article{Zwier2015,
abstract = {The weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling approach orchestrates an ensemble of parallel calculations with intermittent communication to enhance the sampling of rare events, such as molecular associations or conformational changes in proteins or peptides. Trajectories are replicated and pruned in a way that focuses computational effort on underexplored regions of configuration space while maintaining rigorous kinetics. To enable the simulation of rare events at any scale (e.g., atomistic, cellular), we have developed an open-source, interoperable, and highly scalable software package for the execution and analysis of WE simulations: WESTPA (The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis). WESTPA scales to thousands of CPU cores and includes a suite of analysis tools that have been implemented in a massively parallel fashion. The software has been designed to interface conveniently with any dynamics engine and has already been used with a variety of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, AMBER) and cell-modeling packages (e.g., BioNetGen, MCell). WESTPA has been in production use for over a year, and its utility has been demonstrated for a broad set of problems, ranging from atomically detailed host-guest associations to nonspatial chemical kinetics of cellular signaling networks. The following describes the design and features of WESTPA, including the facilities it provides for running WE simulations and storing and analyzing WE simulation data, as well as examples of input and output.},

abstract = {We extend the weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling method to perform rigorous statistical sampling for systems at steady state. A straightforward steady-state implementation of WE is directly practical for simple landscapes, but not when significant metastable intermediates states are present. We therefore develop an enhanced WE scheme, building on existing ideas, which accelerates attainment of steady state in complex systems. We apply both WE approaches to several model systems, confirming their correctness and efficiency by comparison with brute-force results. The enhanced version is significantly faster than the brute force and straightforward WE for systems with WE bins that accurately reflect the reaction coordinate(s). The new WE methods can also be applied to equilibrium sampling, since equilibrium is a steady state. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},
