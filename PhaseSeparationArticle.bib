@article{Liu2020,
abstract = {The energy landscape of biomolecular systems contains many local minima that are separated by high energy barriers. Sampling this landscape in molecular dynamics simulations is a challenging task and often requires the use of enhanced sampling techniques. Here, we increase the sampling efficiency by coupling the fine-grained (FG) GROMOS force field to the coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field via the Hamiltonian replica exchange method (HREM). We tested the efficiency of this procedure using a lutein/octane system. In traditional simulations, cis-trans transitions of lutein are barely observed due to the high energy barrier separating these states. However, many of these transitions are sampled with our HREM scheme. The proposed method offers new possibilities for enhanced sampling of biomolecular conformations, making use of CG models without compromising the accuracy of the FG model.},

abstract = {Transient simulations of dynamic systems, using physics-based scientific computing tools, are practically limited by availability of computational resources and power. While the promise of machine learning has been explored in a variety of scientific disciplines, its application in creation of a framework for computationally expensive transient models has not been fully explored. Here, we present an ensemble approach where one such computationally expensive tool, discrete element method, is combined with time-series forecasting via auto regressive integrated moving average and machine learning methods to simulate a complex pharmaceutical problem: development of an agitation protocol in an agitated filter dryer to ensure uniform solid bed mixing. This ensemble approach leads to a significant reduction in the computational burden, while retaining model accuracy and performance, practically rendering simulations possible. The developed machine-learning model shows good predictability and agreement with the literature, demonstrating its tremendous potential in scientific computing.},

@article{Yesylevskyy2010,
abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have become an essential tool to study a large variety of biomolecular processes, exploring temporal and spatial scales inaccessible to traditional models of atomistic resolution. One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment, is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate. First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane. The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the second application we consider the electroporation process of both an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Yesylevskyy et al.},

abstract = {Diverse cellular signaling events, including B cell receptor (BCR) activation, are hypothesized to be facilitated by domains enriched in specific plasma membrane lipids and proteins that resemble liquid-ordered phase-separated domains in model membranes. This concept remains controversial and lacks direct experimental support in intact cells. Here, we visualize ordered and disordered domains in mouse B lymphoma cell membranes using super-resolution fluorescence localization microscopy, demonstrate that clustered BCR resides within ordered phase-like domains capable of sorting key regulators of BCR activation, and present a minimal, predictive model where clustering receptors leads to their collective activation by stabilizing an extended ordered domain. These results provide evidence for the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling and a plausible mechanism of BCR activation via receptor clustering that could be generalized to other signaling pathways. Overall, these studies demonstrate that lipid mediated forces can bias biochemical networks in ways that broadly impact signal transduction.},

abstract = {We present an improved and extended version of our coarse grained lipid model. The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Klotzsch2013,
abstract = {The plasma membrane is still one of the enigmatic cellular structures. Although the microscopic structure is getting clearer, not much is known about the organization at the nanometre level. Experimental difficulties have precluded unambiguous approaches, making the current picture rather fuzzy. In consequence, a variety of different membrane models has been proposed over the years, on the basis of different experimental strategies. Recent data obtained via high-resolution single-molecule microscopy shed new light on the existing hypotheses. We thus think it is a good time for reviewing the consistency of the existing models with the new data. In this paper, we summarize the available models in ten propositions, each of which is discussed critically with respect to the applied technologies and the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. Our aim is to provide the reader with a sound basis for his own assessment. We close this chapter by exposing our picture of the membrane organization at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {RNA localization mechanisms have been intensively studied and include localized protection of mRNA from degradation, diffusion-coupled local entrapment of mRNA, and directed transport of mRNAs along the cytoskeleton. While it is well understood how cells utilize these three mechanisms to organize mRNAs within the cytoplasm, a newly appreciated mechanism of RNA localization has emerged in recent years in which mRNAs phase-separate and form liquid-like droplets. mRNAs both contribute to condensation of proteins into liquid-like structures and are themselves regulated by being incorporated into membraneless organelles. This ability to condense into droplets is in many instances contributing to previously appreciated mRNA localization phenomena. Here we review how phase separation enables mRNAs to selectively and efficiently colocalize and be coregulated, allowing control of gene expression in time and space.},

We find that cholesterol can induce formation of three regimes of phase behavior: 1) miscible liquid-disordered bulk, 2) phase-separated, domain-registered coexistence of liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered domains, and 3) phase-separated, domain-antiregistered coexistence of liquid-disordered and newly identified nanoscopic gel domains composed of cholesterol threads we name “cholesterolic gel” domains. These findings are validated and discussed in the context of current experimental knowledge, models of cholesterol spatial distributions, and models of ternary lipid-mixture phase separation.},

All the peptides displayed a clear preference for the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase over the liquid-ordered (Lo) one. For BP100, MSI-103, and MSI-78 there was a further preference of the peptides for the domain interface. The peptides' preference toward the disordered phase was shown to reflect a penalization of lipid–lipid interaction enthalpy in the Lo phase, when in the vicinity of peptides. Similar results were observed at the two studied concentrations, although Ld phase saturation at the higher concentration drove some of the peptide excess to the Lo phase. Magainin-2 and MSI-103 were found to dimerize, in agreement with available experimental data. Interestingly, at high concentrations of Magainin-2 toroidal pores spontaneously formed in the Ld phase. We performed additional simulations to characterize this phenomenon, which is likely related to Magainin-2's membranolytic action.},

abstract = {Biological membranes contain a broad variety of lipid species whose individual physicochemical properties and collective interactions ultimately determine membrane organization. A key aspect of the organization of cellular membranes is their lateral subdivision into domains of distinct structure and composition. The most widely studied membrane domains are lipid rafts, which are the biological manifestations of liquid-ordered phases that form in sterol-containing membranes. Detailed studies of biomimetic membrane mixtures have yielded wide-ranging insights into the physical principles behind lipid rafts; however, these simplified models do not fully capture the diversity and complexity of the mammalian lipidome, most notably in their exclusion of polyunsaturated lipids. Here, we assess the role of lipid acyl chain unsaturation as a driving force for phase separation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations validated by model membrane experiments. The clear trends in our observations and good qualitative agreements between simulations and experiments support the conclusions that highly unsaturated lipids promote liquid-liquid domain stability by enhancing the differences in cholesterol content and lipid chain order between the coexisting domains. These observations reveal the important role of noncanonical biological lipids in the physical properties of membranes, showing that lipid polyunsaturation is a driving force for liquid-liquid phase separation.},

@article{Beck-garcia2015,
abstract = {In the last decade an increasing number of plasma membrane (PM) proteins have been shown to be non-randomly distributed but instead forming submicron-sized oligomers called nanoclusters. Nanoclusters exist independently of the ligand-bound state of the receptors and their existence implies a high degree of lateral organisation of the PM and its proteins. The mechanisms that drive receptor nanoclustering are largely unknown. One well-defined example of a transmembrane receptor that forms nanoclusters is the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), a multisubunit protein complex whose nanoclustering influences its activity. Membrane lipids, namely cholesterol and sphingomyelin, have been shown to contribute to TCR nanoclustering. However, the identity of the membrane microdomain in which the TCR resides remains controversial. Using a GFP-labeled TCR we show here that the resting TCR localized in the disordered domain of giant PM vesicles (GPMVs) and PM spheres (PMSs) and that single and nanoclustered TCRs are found in the high-density fractions in sucrose gradients. Both findings are indicative of non-raft localization. We discuss possible mechanisms of TCR nanoclustering in T cells. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nanoscale membrane organisation and signalling.},

abstract = {Understanding the lateral organization in plasma membranes remains an open problem despite a large body of research. Model membranes with coexisting micrometer-size domains are routinely employed as simplified models of plasma membranes. Many molecular dynamics simulations have investigated phase separation in model membranes at the coarse-grained level, but atomistic simulations remain computationally challenging. We simulate DPPC:DOPC and DPPC:DOPC:cholesterol lipid bilayers to investigate phase transitions at temperatures from 310 to 270 K. In this temperature range, the binary mixture forms a liquid phase (L$\alpha$) and a coexistence of L$\alpha$ and either gel or ripple phases. The ternary mixture forms a liquid disordered (Ld) phase and a coexistence of liquid ordered (Lo) and either Ld or gel phases. We quantify the coexisting phases and discuss their properties against the background of experimental results. We observe partial registration of growing domains in both mixtures. We characterize specific cholesterol-cholesterol and cholesterol-phospholipid interaction geometries underlying its increased partitioning and the smoothed phase transition in the ternary mixture compared to the binary mixture. By comparing coexisting domains with homogeneous bilayers of the same composition, we demonstrate how domain coexistence affects their properties. Our simulations provide important insights into the lipid-lipid interactions in model lipid bilayers and improve our understanding of the lateral organization in plasma membranes with higher compositional complexity.},

@article{Banani2016,
abstract = {Cellular bodies such as P bodies and PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs) appear to be phase-separated liquids organized by multivalent interactions among proteins and RNA molecules. Although many components of various cellular bodies are known, general principles that define body composition are lacking. We modeled cellular bodies using several engineered multivalent proteins and RNA. In vitro and in cells, these scaffold molecules form phase-separated liquids that concentrate low valency client proteins. Clients partition differently depending on the ratio of scaffolds, with a sharp switch across the phase diagram diagonal. Composition can switch rapidly through changes in scaffold concentration or valency. Natural PML NBs and P bodies show analogous partitioning behavior, suggesting how their compositions could be controlled by levels of PML SUMOylation or cellular mRNA concentration, respectively. The data suggest a conceptual framework for considering the composition and control thereof of cellular bodies assembled through heterotypic multivalent interactions.},

@article{Ray2020,
abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein ($\alpha$-Syn) aggregation and amyloid formation is directly linked with Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. However, the early events involved in this process remain unclear. Here, using the in vitro reconstitution and cellular model, we show that liquid–liquid phase separation of $\alpha$-Syn precedes its aggregation. In particular, in vitro generated $\alpha$-Syn liquid-like droplets eventually undergo a liquid-to-solid transition and form an amyloid hydrogel that contains oligomers and fibrillar species. Factors known to aggravate $\alpha$-Syn aggregation, such as low pH, phosphomimetic substitution and familial Parkinson's disease mutations, also promote $\alpha$-Syn liquid–liquid phase separation and its subsequent maturation. We further demonstrate $\alpha$-Syn liquid-droplet formation in cells. These cellular $\alpha$-Syn droplets eventually transform into perinuclear aggresomes, the process regulated by microtubules. This work provides detailed insights into the phase-separation behaviour of natively unstructured $\alpha$-Syn and its conversion to a disease-associated aggregated state, which is highly relevant in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.

@article{Marigo2012,
abstract = {The mixing of solids is a fundamentally important unit operation in the pharmaceutical, food and agricultural industries, as well as many others. The efficiency and quality of mixing can have a significant bearing on downstream processability and product quality. In spite of the fact that the equipment, usually batch blenders without impellers such as tumbling bins and V-Blenders or with impellers such as ploughshare mixers, is well established, there remains considerable uncertainty in the optimisation of mixing. Simple laboratory/pilot scale mixers based on the rotating drum, such as the hoop mixer and the Turbula, are commonly used and yet also little understood in terms of performance. These mixers add additional rotational and/or translational movements to the cylindrical rotation of the drum to deliver significant improvements in mixing, particularly in the longitudinal axis.Discrete Element Modelling (DEM), in which a flowing or deforming granular system is modelled by considering the movement of each individual particle and its interaction (momentum and energy exchange) with neighbours and boundaries, has recently become accessible to relatively non-expert users. The reasons for this include: increasing confidence in its capability; user-friendly graphical interfaces of commercial software packages; and the fact that top end personal computers now have sufficient memory and computational speed to enable many problems to be solved in weeks rather than months.The purpose of the work reported here is to evaluate the power of DEM to help understand flow processes and explain mixing mechanisms in mixing equipment based on the rotating drum. The commercial package EDEM (from DEM Solutions) was used. For speed and simplicity the modelled system comprised monosized smooth glass beads. Three mixers were selected: horizontal rotating drum, the hoop mixer and the Turbula. The rate and extent of mixing, quantified using a "segregation index" based on contacts between two discretely labelled but otherwise identical fractions, was shown to depend on equipment motion, operating speed and the initial distribution of the fractions. The well known characteristics of the horizontal drum operating in rolling mode were demonstrated: excellent transverse mixing and poor axial mixing; both improving with speed as the depth of the active layer is shown to increase. The hoop mixer incorporates off-axis rotation, causing periodic tilting of the cylinder axis. This results in a considerable improvement in axial mixing. Interestingly, at low speeds the hoop mixer and simple rotating drum exhibit similar transverse mixing but increasing speed has the opposite effect: improving transverse mixing in the drum while worsening it in the hoop. Axial mixing in the hoop mixer, on the other hand improves with speed. The Turbula displays a very interesting relationship with speed. At low speeds, its transverse mixing performance is the same as the horizontal drum and hoop mixer but decreases significantly with increasing speed, going through a minimum at medium speed before recovering completely at high speed. Axial mixing is comparable, showing the same trend. It appears that the motion in the Turbula goes through some sort of transition that has a profound effect on mixing performance. The implication is that unless this is understood, it will be difficult a priori to identify optimum operating conditions.The power of DEM lies in the fact that the complete trajectory of each particle is recorded: it is possible to follow the movement, deformation and breakup of clusters of particles. From this it should be possible to elucidate the dominant flow mechanisms and to identify those that have the most impact on mixing. This presents a challenge to develop methodologies for cluster analysis and visualisation and is the subject of on-going work. Other work is focussed on experimental validation of the DEM predictions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The phase behavior of the coarse-grained MARTINI model for three-component lipid bilayers composed of dipalmytoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol (Chol), and an unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) was systematically investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The aim of this study is to understand which types of unsaturated PC induce the formation of thermodynamically stable coexisting phases when added to mixtures of DPPC and Chol and to unravel the mechanisms that drive phase separation in such three-component mixtures. Our simulations indicate that the currently used MARTINI force field does not induce such phase separation in mixtures of DPPC, Chol, and unsaturated PCs with a low unsaturation level, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) or dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Also, we found that phase separation does occur in mixtures of DPPC, Chol, and polyunsaturated PCs, such as dilinoleyl-phosphatidylcholine (DUPC) and diarachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DAPC). Through systematic tweaking of the interactions between the hydrophobic groups of the PC molecules, we show that the appearance of phase separation in three-component lipid bilayers, as modeled through the MARTINI force field, is primarily due to the interactions between the coarse-grained molecules, i.e., the beads, rather than due to the differences between the conformations of saturated and unsaturated lipid acyl chains, namely entropy driven.

Results reveal that the MAB binning scheme, despite its simplicity, is more efficient than a manual, fixed binning scheme in generating transitions over large free energy barriers, generating a diversity of pathways, estimating rate constants, and sampling conformations.

Its ability to act both as a catalyst and a storage mechanism for genetic information is also an important part of the RNA world hypothesis. Compartmentalization within modern cells allows the local concentration of RNA to be controlled and it has been suggested that this was also important in early life forms. Here, we mimic intracellular compartmentalization and macromolecular crowding by partitioning RNA in an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). We show that the concentration of RNA is enriched by up to 3,000-fold in the dextran-rich phase of a polyethylene glycol/dextran ATPS and demonstrate that this can lead to approximately 70-fold increase in the rate of ribozyme cleavage. This rate enhancement can be tuned by the relative volumes of the two phases in the ATPS. Our observations support the importance of compartmentalization in the attainment of function in an RNA World as well as in modern biology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

By generating Ras nanoclusters in direct proportion to ligand input, cells build an analogue-digital-analogue circuit relay that transmits a signal across the plasma membrane with high fidelity. Signal transmission is completely dependent on Ras spatial organization and fails if nanoclustering is abrogated.

This refined Martini model was reported to reproduce experimental phase diagrams for a ternary DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol mixture, including the coexistence of two liquid phases. However, we demonstrate that this coexistence only emerged due to an unfortunate choice of simulation parameters, which leads to poor energy conservation. Specifically, the constraints on the cholesterol model drained energy out from the membrane, resulting in two coexisting phases at drastically different temperatures. Using the simulation parameters recommended for the used cholesterol model, this artefact is eliminated, yet so is phase coexistence, i.e. experimental phase diagrams are no longer reproduced. It is important to highlight that the present comment was submitted to Chemical Theory and Computation. However, it was rejected without peer-review by the Editor-in-Chief, who stated that the journal "rarely publishes such material".},

@article{Veatch2003,
abstract = {We use fluorescence microscopy to directly observe liquid phases in giant unilamellar vesicles. We find that a long list of ternary mixtures of high melting temperature (saturated) lipids, low melting temperature (usually unsaturated) lipids, and cholesterol produce liquid domains. For one model mixture in particular, DPPC/DOPC/Chol, we have mapped phase boundaries for the full ternary system. For this mixture we observe two coexisting liquid phases over a wide range of lipid composition and temperature, with one phase rich in the unsaturated lipid and the other rich in the saturated lipid and cholesterol. We find a simple relationship between chain melting temperature and miscibility transition temperature that holds for both phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin lipids. We experimentally cross miscibility boundaries both by changing temperature and by the depletion of cholesterol with $\beta$-cyclodextrin. Liquid domains in vesicles exhibit interesting behavior: they collide and coalesce, can finger into stripes, and can bulge out of the vesicle. To date, we have not observed macroscopic separation of liquid phases in only binary lipid mixtures.},

@article{Laganowsky2014,
abstract = {Previous studies have established that the folding, structure and function of membrane proteins are influenced by their lipid environments and that lipids can bind to specific sites, for example, in potassium channels. Fundamental questions remain however regarding the extent of membrane protein selectivity towards lipids. Here we report a mass spectrometry approach designed to determine the selectivity of lipid binding to membrane protein complexes. We investigate the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) and the ammonia channel (AmtB) from Escherichia coli, using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), which reports gas-phase collision cross-sections. We demonstrate that folded conformations of membrane protein complexes can exist in the gas phase. By resolving lipid-bound states, we then rank bound lipids on the basis of their ability to resist gas phase unfolding and thereby stabilize membrane protein structure. Lipids bind non-selectively and with high avidity to MscL, all imparting comparable stability; however, the highest-ranking lipid is phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in line with its proposed functional role in mechanosensation. AqpZ is also stabilized by many lipids, with cardiolipin imparting the most significant resistance to unfolding. Subsequently, through functional assays we show that cardiolipin modulates AqpZ function. Similar experiments identify AmtB as being highly selective for phosphatidylglycerol, prompting us to obtain an X-ray structure in this lipid membrane-like environment. The 2.3 {\AA} resolution structure, when compared with others obtained without lipid bound, reveals distinct conformational changes that re-position AmtB residues to interact with the lipid bilayer. Our results demonstrate that resistance to unfolding correlates with specific lipid-binding events, enabling a distinction to be made between lipids that merely bind from those that modulate membrane protein structure and/or function. We anticipate that these findings will be important not only for defining the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids, but also for understanding the role of lipids in modulating protein function or drug binding. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The WE strategy can achieve superlinear scaling—the unbiased estimation of key observables such as rate constants and equilibrium state populations to greater precision than would be possible with ordinary parallel simulation. WE software can be used to control any dynamics engine, such as standard molecular dynamics and cell-modeling packages. This article reviews the theoretical basis of WE and goes on to describe successful applications to a number of complex biological processes—protein conformational transitions, (un)binding, and assembly processes, as well as cell-scale processes in systems biology. We furthermore discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in the next phase of WE methodological development. Overall, the combined advances in WE methodology and software have enabled the simulation of long-timescale processes that would otherwise not be practical on typical computing resources using standard simulation.},

This review aims to present the unifying principles and differences of many of the computational methods currenly used for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. Indeed, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a relatively limited number of statistical and physical principles. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using similar terminology and notation. We then illustrate in which ways many different methods combine principles from a smaller class of enhanced sampling concepts. This review is intended for scientists with an understanding of the basics of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical physics who want a deeper understanding of the ideas that underlie various enhanced sampling methods and the relationships between them.

Trajectories are replicated and pruned in a way that focuses computational effort on underexplored regions of configuration space while maintaining rigorous kinetics. To enable the simulation of rare events at any scale (e.g., atomistic, cellular), we have developed an open-source, interoperable, and highly scalable software package for the execution and analysis of WE simulations: WESTPA (The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis). WESTPA scales to thousands of CPU cores and includes a suite of analysis tools that have been implemented in a massively parallel fashion. The software has been designed to interface conveniently with any dynamics engine and has already been used with a variety of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, AMBER) and cell-modeling packages (e.g., BioNetGen, MCell). WESTPA has been in production use for over a year, and its utility has been demonstrated for a broad set of problems, ranging from atomically detailed host-guest associations to nonspatial chemical kinetics of cellular signaling networks. The following describes the design and features of WESTPA, including the facilities it provides for running WE simulations and storing and analyzing WE simulation data, as well as examples of input and output.},

abstract = {Membrane binding of the HIV-1 group-specific antigen (Gag) structural protein, a critical step in viral assembly at the plasma membrane, is mediated by the myristoylated, highly basic matrix (MA) domain, which interacts with negatively charged lipids in the inner leaflet. According to a popular model, virus particles bud from membrane rafts, microdomains enriched in cholesterol and highmelting phospholipids with higher order than found outside rafts. How Gag might recognize membrane rafts, if they exist in the inner leaflet, is unknown. Using a liposome flotation assay with proteins translated in vitro, we investigated whether Gag can sense the composition of the hydrophobic part of the bilayer, by fixing lipid head group composition and varying hydrophobic properties. In liposomes composed solely of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine, and with the same overall membrane negative charge, Gag strongly preferred lipids with both acyl chains unsaturated over those with only one chain unsaturated. Adding cholesterol increased Gag binding and led to closer packing of phospholipids. However, higher membrane order, as measured by electron spin resonance, was not correlated with increased Gag binding. Gag proteins from two other retroviruses gave similar results. These liposome binding preferences were qualitatively recapitulated by purified myristoylated HIV-1 MA. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and cholesterol enhanced binding in an additive manner. Taken together, these results show that Gag is sensitive both to the acyl chains of phosphatidylserine and to cholesterol concentration and other details of the membrane environment. These observations may help explain how retroviruses acquire a raft-like lipid composition.},

@article{Li2016,
abstract = {The presumptive altered dynamics of transient molecular interactions in vivo contributing to neurodegenerative diseases have remained elusive. Here, using single-molecule localization microscopy, we show that disease-inducing Huntingtin (mHtt) protein fragments display three distinct dynamic states in living cells – 1) fast diffusion, 2) dynamic clustering and 3) stable aggregation. Large, stable aggregates of mHtt exclude chromatin and form 'sticky' decoy traps that impede target search processes of key regulators involved in neurological disorders. Functional domain mapping based on super-resolution imaging reveals an unexpected role of aromatic amino acids in promoting protein-mHtt aggregate interactions. Genome-wide expression analysis and numerical simulation experiments suggest mHtt aggregates reduce transcription factor target site sampling frequency and impair critical gene expression programs in striatal neurons. Together, our results provide insights into how mHtt dynamically forms aggregates and disrupts the finely-balanced gene control mechanisms in neuronal cells.Huntington's disease belongs to a group of human genetic disorders in which faulty proteins cause nerve cells to progressively die. All proteins are made from building blocks called amino acids, and these diseases are collectively called PolyQ expansion diseases because the faulty proteins usually have an abnormally long stretch that contains many repeats of an amino acid called glutamine. The stretches of glutamines make these mutant proteins stick to each other, which means that they aggregate in the diseased cells.Researchers have proposed several mechanisms to explain how aggregates of one such mutant protein, called mutant Huntingtin (mHtt), might contribute to Huntington's disease. One possibility is that mHtt accumulates in the nucleus of the cell – which houses most of the cell's DNA – and interferes with the proteins that are required to switch genes on or off. Preventing these gene regulatory proteins from carrying out their role could disrupt the normal pattern of gene activity. However, working out if this is the case would require researchers being able to follow how mHtt forms aggregates and interferes with normal processes in living cells.Li et al. have now used high-resolution, high-speed microscopy to directly track the movement of individual mHtt proteins in living mouse cells in real time. The analysis showed that PolyQ protein fragments of mHtt behaved in three distinct ways – they diffused, briefly clustered or stably aggregated. Large stable aggregates of mHtt created decoy-like traps that interfered with the behavior of the gene regulatory proteins. Using computer-aided simulations, Li et al. then showed that that these molecular traps make the proteins take much longer to find their true target genes. Further studies in nerve cells suggested that this phenomenon disrupted the normal pattern of gene activity.Next, Li et al. also used the live cell imaging system to look at which gene regulatory proteins were sequestered in the mHtt aggregates. This approach identified proteins that are important regulators involved in a number of neurological disorders. These proteins included some with long stretches of glutamines and unexpectedly others in which the glutamines were interspersed with other amino acids. Aggregates of mHtt therefore appear to affect a much broader range of proteins than previously thought. Together, the results provide insight into how mHtt forms aggregates and disrupts the finely balanced mechanisms that control gene activity in nerve cells. Future studies could explore the general principles that determine which proteins interact with mHtt aggregates. This could help reveal the faulty processes that underlie Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.},

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

Based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a high-resolution view of the lipid organization of a plasma membrane at an unprecedented level of complexity. Our plasma membrane model consists of 63 different lipid species, combining 14 types of headgroups and 11 types of tails asymmetrically distributed across the two leaflets, closely mimicking an idealized mammalian plasma membrane. We observe an enrichment of cholesterol in the outer leaflet and a general non-ideal lateral mixing of the different lipid species. Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets. In the outer leaflet, distinct nanodomains consisting of gangliosides are observed. Phosphoinositides show preferential clustering in the inner leaflet. Our data provide a key view on the lateral organization of lipids in one of lifes fundamental structures, the cell membrane.},

@article{Doma2012,
abstract = {We studied compositionally heterogeneous multi-component model membranes comprised of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, cholesterol, and $\alpha$-helical TM protein models using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Reducing the mismatch between the length of the saturated and unsaturated lipid tails reduced the driving force for segregation into liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) lipid domains. Cholesterol depletion had a similar effect, and binary lipid mixtures without cholesterol did not undergo large-scale phase separation under the simulation conditions. The phase-separating ternary dipalmitoyl- phosphatidylcholine (DPPC)/dilinoleoyl-PC (DLiPC)/cholesterol bilayer was found to segregate into lo and ld domains also in the presence of a high concentration of ΤΜ helices. The ld domain was highly crowded with TM helices (protein-to-lipid ratio {\~{}} 1:5), slowing down lateral diffusion by a factor of 5-10 as compared to the dilute case, with anomalous (sub)-diffusion on the $\mu$s time scale. The membrane with the less strongly unsaturated palmitoyl-linoleoyl-PC instead of DLiPC, which in the absence of TM $\alpha$-helices less strongly deviated from ideal mixing, could be brought closer to a miscibility critical point by introducing a high concentration of TM helices. Finally, the 7-TM protein bacteriorhodopsin was found to partition into the ld domains irrespective of hydrophobic matching. These results show that it is possible to directly study the lateral reorganization of lipids and proteins in compositionally heterogeneous and crowded model biomembranes with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, a step toward simulations of realistic, compositionally complex cellular membranes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The transmembrane domain (TMD) of membrane proteins plays an essential role in their dynamics and functions. Certain properties of TMDs, such as raft affinity and orientation, have been studied extensively both experimentally and computationally. However, the extent to which specific physicochemical properties of TMDs determine their membrane domain-partitioning thermodynamics is still far from clear. In this work, we propose an approach based on umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations of model membranes and idealized TMDs to quantify the effect of TMD physicochemical properties, namely, length, degree of hydrophobicity, and size of TMDs, on their membrane domain-partitioning thermodynamics. The results, which are fully consistent with previous experimental and simulation data, indicate that the concept of "hydrophobic mismatch" should go beyond differences in hydrophobic thickness to include mismatch in the degree of hydrophobicity between the TMD and the surrounding hydrocarbon lipid chains. Our method provides quantitative insights into the role of specific physicochemical features of TMDs in membrane localization and orientation, which will be broadly useful for predicting the raft affinity and membrane partitioning of any transmembrane protein.},

@article{Valsson2016,
abstract = {Atomistic simulations play a central role in many fields of science. However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics.},

In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

The physiological functions and molecular triggers of liquid demixing by phase separation are not well understood. Here we show in vitro and in vivo that the nucleic acid-mimicking biopolymer poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) nucleates intracellular liquid demixing. PAR levels are markedly induced at sites of DNA damage, and we provide evidence that PAR-seeded liquid demixing results in rapid, yet transient and fully reversible assembly of various intrinsically disordered proteins at DNA break sites. Demixing, which relies on electrostatic interactions between positively charged RGG repeats and negatively charged PAR, is amplified by aggregation-prone prion-like domains, and orchestrates the earliest cellular responses to DNA breakage. We propose that PAR-seeded liquid demixing is a general mechanism to dynamically reorganize the soluble nuclear space with implications for pathological protein aggregation caused by derailed phase separation.},

In general, translation and steps in the major pathway of mRNA decay are in competition with each other. mRNAs that are not engaged in translation can aggregate into cytoplasmic mRNP granules referred to as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules, which are related to mRNP particles that control translation in early development and neurons. Analyses of P-bodies and stress granules suggest a dynamic process, referred to as the mRNA Cycle, wherein mRNPs can move between polysomes, P-bodies and stress granules although the functional roles of mRNPassembly into higher order structures remain poorly understood. In this article, we review what is known about the coupling of translation and mRNA degradation, the properties of P-bodies and stress granules, and how assembly of mRNPs into larger structures might influence cellular function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.},

@article{Fowler2016,
abstract = {Characterizing the nanoscale dynamic organization within lipid bilayer membranes is central to our understanding of cell membranes at a molecular level. We investigate phase separation and communication across leaflets in ternary lipid bilayers, including saturated lipids with between 12 and 20 carbons per tail. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal a novel two-step kinetics due to hydrophobic mismatch, in which the initial response of the apposed leaflets upon quenching is to increase local asymmetry (antiregistration), followed by dominance of symmetry (registration) as the bilayer equilibrates. Antiregistration can become thermodynamically preferred if domain size is restricted below ∼20 nm, with implications for the symmetry of rafts and nanoclusters in cell membranes, which have similar reported sizes. We relate our findings to theory derived from a semimicroscopic model in which the leaflets experience a "direct" area-dependent coupling, and an "indirect" coupling that arises from hydrophobic mismatch and is most important at domain boundaries. Registered phases differ in composition from antiregistered phases, consistent with a direct coupling between the leaflets. Increased hydrophobic mismatch purifies the phases, suggesting that it contributes to the molecule-level lipid immiscibility. Our results demonstrate an interplay of competing interleaflet couplings that affect phase compositions and kinetics, and lead to a length scale that can influence lateral and transverse bilayer organization within cells.},

Here, we reparametrize these residues either through reassignment of particle types or by introducing embedded charges. The new parameters are tested with respect to partitioning across a lipid bilayer, membrane binding of Wimley-White peptides, and dimerization free energy in solvents of different polarity.

J. 1996, 70, 97-110] to generate equilibrium trajectory ensembles and extract nonequilibrium subsets for computing kinetic quantities. States do not need to be chosen in advance. The procedure formally allows estimation of kinetic rates between arbitrary states chosen after the simulation, along with their equilibrium populations. We also describe a related history-dependent matrix procedure for estimating equilibrium and nonequilibrium observables when phase space has been divided into arbitrary non-Markovian regions, whether in WE or ordinary simulation. In this proof-of-principle study, these methods are successfully applied and validated on two molecular systems: explicitly solvated methane association and the implicitly solvated Ala4 peptide.

@article{Degreif2019,
abstract = {Cells maintain physicochemical characteristics of membranes in order to allow for proper function of membrane-associated cellular processes, such as endocytosis and exocytosis. To investigate the interplay between membrane properties and biological processes, we applied lipid engineering approaches that allowed for systematic manipulation of fatty acid unsaturation and sterol biosynthesis, the main regulators of membrane fluidity. In combination with electrophysiological membrane capacitance measurements, we were able to study the dependence of the endo- and exocytic activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on membrane lipid composition in vivo. We found that a strong decrease in the cell's total ergosterol content leads to a severely reduced frequency of vesicle fission (endocytosis), whereas the exocytic activity remained largely unaffected. In contrast, increased lipid saturation lowered both endocytic and the exocytic activity, with the former being more severely affected. We were able to correlate the decreased ratio of endocytic/exocytic frequencies (f endo /f exo ) upon lipid perturbation with the growth of yeast protoplasts, which is based on a surface enlargement resulting from a net excess of exocytic over endocytic flux. Experiments using clathrin-deficient mutants confirm a correlation between reduced endocytic activity and increased size of intact walled cells, as well as accelerated protoplast growth. These data show that lipid composition is intimately tied to membrane trafficking in yeast cells and suggest that endocytosis is particularly dependent on the lipid-defined properties of cell membrane.},

abstract = {Cell membranes contain a large number of different lipid species. Such a multicomponent mixture exhibits a complex phase behavior with regions of structural and compositional heterogeneity. Especially domains formed in ternary mixtures, composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids together with cholesterol, have received a lot of attention as they may resemble raft formation in real cells. Here we apply a simulation model to assess the molecular nature of these domains at the nanoscale, information that has thus far eluded experimental determination. We are able to show the spontaneous separation of a saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC)/unsaturated PC/cholesterol mixture into a liquid-ordered and a liquid-disordered phase with structural and dynamic properties closely matching experimental data. The near-atomic resolution of the simulations reveals remarkable features of both domains and the boundary domain interface. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a small surface tension between the monolayer leaflets that drives registration of the domains. At the level of molecular detail, raft-like lipid mixtures show a surprising face with possible implications for many cell membrane processes.},

@article{Janosi2012,
abstract = {Recent experiments have shown that membrane-bound Ras proteins form transient, nanoscale signaling platforms that play a crucial role in high-fidelity signal transmission. However, a detailed characterization of these dynamic proteolipid substructures by high-resolution experimental techniques remains elusive. Here we use extensive semiatomic simulations to reveal the molecular basis for the formation and domain-specific distribution of Ras nanoclusters. As model systems,we chose the triply lipidated membrane targeting motif of H-ras (tH) and a large bilayer made up of di16:0-PC (DPPC), di18:2-PC (DLiPC), and cholesterol. We found that 4-10 tH molecules assemble into clusters that undergo molecular exchange in the sub-$\mu$s to $\mu$s time scale, depending on the simulation temperature and hence the stability of lipid domains. Driven by the opposite preference of tH palmitoyls and farnesyl for ordered and disordered membrane domains, clustered tH molecules segregate to the boundary of lipid domains. Additionally, a systematic analysis of depalmitoylated and defarnesylated tH variants allowed us to decipher the role of individual lipid modifications in domain-specific nanocluster localization and thereby explain why homologous Ras isoforms form nonoverlapping nanoclusters. Moreover, the localization of tH nanoclusters at domain boundaries resulted in a significantly lower line tension and increased membrane curvature. Taken together, these results provide a unique mechanistic insight into how protein assembly promoted by lipid-modification modulates bilayer shape to generate functional signaling platforms.},

However, many such RNP bodies contain internal subcompartments, and the mechanism of their formation remains unclear. Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro studies, together with computational modeling, to show that subcompartments within the nucleolus represent distinct, coexisting liquid phases. Consistent with their in vivo immiscibility, purified nucleolar proteins phase separate into droplets containing distinct non-coalescing phases that are remarkably similar to nucleoli in vivo. This layered droplet organization is caused by differences in the biophysical properties of the phases - particularly droplet surface tension - which arises from sequence-encoded features of their macromolecular components. These results suggest that phase separation can give rise to multilayered liquids that may facilitate sequential RNA processing reactions in a variety of RNP bodies.},

In this perspective, we review a variety of enhanced sampling methods. We first discuss collective-variables-based methods including metadynamics and variationally enhanced sampling. Then, collective variable free methods such as parallel tempering and integrated tempering methods are presented. At last, we conclude with a brief introduction of some newly developed combinatory methods. We summarize in this perspective not only the theoretical background and numerical implementation of these methods but also the new challenges and prospects in the field of the enhanced sampling.},

abstract = {Gene silencing by heterochromatin is proposed to occur in part as a result of the ability of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins to spread across large regions of the genome, compact the underlying chromatin and recruit diverse ligands. Here we identify a new property of the human HP1$\alpha$ protein: The ability to form phase-separated droplets. While unmodified HP1$\alpha$ is soluble, either phosphorylation of its N-Terminal extension or DNA binding promotes the formation of phase-separated droplets. Phosphorylation-driven phase separation can be promoted or reversed by specific HP1$\alpha$ ligands. Known components of heterochromatin such as nucleosomes and DNA preferentially partition into the HP1$\alpha$ droplets, but molecules such as the transcription factor TFIIB show no preference. Using a single-molecule DNA curtain assay, we find that both unmodified and phosphorylated HP1$\alpha$ induce rapid compaction of DNA strands into puncta, although with different characteristics. We show by direct protein delivery into mammalian cells that an HP1$\alpha$ mutant incapable of phase separation in vitro forms smaller and fewer nuclear puncta than phosphorylated HP1$\alpha$. These findings suggest that heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing may occur in part through sequestration of compacted chromatin in phase-separated HP1 droplets, which are dissolved or formed by specific ligands on the basis of nuclear context.},

abstract = {Expansions of short nucleotide repeats produce several neurological and neuromuscular disorders including Huntington disease, muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A common pathological feature of these diseases is the accumulation of the repeat-containing transcripts into aberrant foci in the nucleus. RNA foci, as well as the disease symptoms, only manifest above a critical number of nucleotide repeats, but the molecular mechanism governing foci formation above this characteristic threshold remains unresolved. Here we show that repeat expansions create templates for multivalent base-pairing, which causes purified RNA to undergo a sol-gel transition in vitro at a similar critical repeat number as observed in the diseases. In human cells, RNA foci form by phase separation of the repeat-containing RNA and can be dissolved by agents that disrupt RNA gelation in vitro. Analogous to protein aggregation disorders, our results suggest that the sequence-specific gelation of RNAs could be a contributing factor to neurological disease.},

abstract = {A new method, weighted-ensemble Brownian dynamics, is proposed for the simulation of protein-association reactions and other events whose frequencies of outcomes are constricted by free energy barriers. The method features a weighted ensemble of trajectories in configuration space with energy levels dictating the proper correspondence between 'particles' and probability. Instead of waiting a very long time for an unlikely event to occur, the probability packets are split, and small packets of probability are allowed to diffuse almost immediately into regions of configuration space that are less likely to be sampled. The method has been applied to the Northrup and Erickson (1992) model of docking-type diffusion-limited reactions and yields reaction rate constants in agreement with those obtained by direct Brownian simulation, but at a fraction of the CPU time (10-4 to 10-3, depending on the model). Because the method is essentially a variant of standard Brownian dynamics algorithms, it is anticipated that weighted- ensemble Brownian dynamics, in conjunction with biophysical force models, can be applied to a large class of association reactions of interest to the biophysics community.},

abstract = {Cholesterol is a key component of eukaryotic membranes, but its role in cellular biology in general and in lipid rafts in particular remains controversial. Model membranes are used extensively to determine the phase behavior of ternary mixtures of cholesterol, a saturated lipid, and an unsaturated lipid with liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phase coexistence. Despite many different experiments that determine lipid-phase diagrams, we lack an understanding of the molecular-level driving forces for liquid phase coexistence in bilayers with cholesterol. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics computer simulations to address the driving forces for phase coexistence in ternary lipid mixtures. Domain formation is directly observed in a long-timescale simulation of a mixture of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, unsaturated 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol. Free-energy calculations for the exchange of the saturated and unsaturated lipids between the ordered and disordered phases give insight into the mixing behavior. We show that a large energetic contribution to domain formation is favorable enthalpic interactions of the saturated lipid in the ordered phase. This favorable energy for forming an ordered, cholesterol-rich phase is opposed by a large unfavorable entropy. Martini coarse-grained simulations capture the unfavorable free energy of mixing but do not reproduce the entropic contribution because of the reduced representation of the phospholipid tails. Phospholipid tails and their degree of unsaturation are key energetic contributors to lipid phase separation.},

Here, we describe a new algorithm for finding optimal low-dimensional CVs for use in enhanced-sampling biasing methods like umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and related methods, when limited prior static and dynamic information is known about the system, and a much larger set of candidate CVs is specified. The algorithm involves estimating the best combination of these candidate CVs, as quantified by a maximum path entropy estimate of the spectral gap for dynamics viewed as a function of that CV. The algorithm is called spectral gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP). Through multiple practical examples, we show how this postprocessing procedure can lead to optimization of CV and several orders of magnitude improvement in the convergence of the free energy calculated through metadynamics, essentially giving the ability to extract useful information even from unsuccessful metadynamics runs.},

Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple but powerful extension based on the notion of conditional probability factorization where known features are washed out to learn additional and possibly hidden features of the energy landscape. We show how SGOOP can be used to proceed in a sequential and bottom-up manner to (i) systematically probe the need for extending the dimensionality of the RC, and (ii) if such a need is identified, learn additional coordinates of the RC in a computationally efficient manner. We formulate the method and demonstrate its usefulness through three illustrative examples, including the challenging and important problem of calculating the kinetics of benzene unbinding from the protein T4L99A lysozyme, where we obtain excellent agreement in terms of dissociation pathway and kinetics with other sampling methods and experiments. In this last case, starting from a larger dictionary of fairly generic and arbitrarily chosen 11 order parameters, we demonstrate how to automatically learn a 2-dimensional RC, which we then use in the infrequent metadynamics protocol to obtain 16 independent unbinding trajectories. We believe our method will be a big step in increasing the usefulness of SGOOP in performing intuition-free sampling of complex systems. Finally, we believe that the usefulness of our protocol is amplified by its applicability to not just SGOOP but also other generic methods for constructing the RC.},

  abstract     = {Here we propose the reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than 3 min, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics.},

  abstract        = {Understanding kinetics including reaction pathways and associated transition rates is an important yet difficult problem in numerous chemical and biological systems, especially in situations with multiple competing pathways. When these high-dimensional systems are projected on low-dimensional coordinates, which are often needed for enhanced sampling or for interpretation of simulations and experiments, one can end up losing the kinetic connectivity of the underlying high-dimensional landscape. Thus, in the low-dimensional projection, metastable states might appear closer or further than they actually are. To deal with this issue, in this work, we develop a formalism that learns a multidimensional yet minimally complex reaction coordinate (RC) for generic high-dimensional systems. When projected along this RC, all possible kinetically relevant pathways can be demarcated and the true high-dimensional connectivity is maintained. One of the defining attributes of our method lies in that it can work on long unbiased simulations as well as biased simulations often needed for rare event systems. We demonstrate the utility of the method by studying a range of model systems including conformational transitions in a small peptide Ace-Ala -Nme, where we show how two-dimensional and three-dimensional RCs found by our previously published spectral gap optimization method "SGOOP" [Tiwary, P. and Berne, B. J.      , 2839] can capture the kinetics for 23 and all 28 out of the 28 dominant state-to-state transitions, respectively.},
