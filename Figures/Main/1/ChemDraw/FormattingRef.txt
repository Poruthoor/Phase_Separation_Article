I found the following useful comment in the ChemDraw forum: https://chemmazing.perkinelmerinformatics.com/conversations/chemdraw-prime/changing-the-drawing-settings/627a8cb7c10fd3205efd06dd

1. To change the thickness of figure and text

Either at the document level (File > Document Settings) or at the Object Level (select Object then Object > Object Settings) you can change the look and feel of your molecules and your drawings. 

Under Drawing section: 

- Fixed Length: 0.2 in (or 0.22 in if you work with crowded structures in 3D)

- Spacing: 14% of the length

- Line width: 0.02 in

- Margin: 0.02 in

- Bold width: 0.04 in

- Hash: 0.03 in

Under Atom Labels Section:

- Atom labels: Arial, 10, Bold

2. To change the light background to dark

At the document level (File > Document Settings)

Under Colors section: Change the foreground and background colors to white and black, respectively.
